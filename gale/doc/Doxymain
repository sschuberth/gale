<h2>Introduction</h2>
As stated on the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gale/">project page</a>, the "Graphics Abstraction Layer & Engine" is a object oriented wrapper for OpenGL and its extensions. GALE is designed to be modern, lightweight and self-consistent, and is particularly targeted at Demo Scene effects, tech demos and GPGPU applications.

There also is a sub-project to GALE called <a href="http://gale.berlios.de/glex/">GLEX</a>, an "OpenGL Extension Specification Parser", which is used to turn a single OpenGL extension specification text file or URL into a set of compact C source files that can be easily included into existing projects to initialize the desired extension.
