<h2>Introduction</h2>
As stated on the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gale/">project page</a>, the "Graphics Abstraction Layer & Engine" is an OO wrapper for OpenGL and more. GALE is designed to be modern, lightweight and self-consistent. It is particularly targeted at non-interactive programs like tech demos and GPGPU applications.

You can probably think of it as something similar but far less extensive than the great <a href="http://www.geometrictools.com/">Wild Magic</a> or <a href="http://g3d-cpp.sourceforge.net/">G3D</a> libraries, however with a focus on very compact programs.

There also is a sub-project to GALE called <a href="http://gale.berlios.de/glex/">GLEX</a>, an "OpenGL Extension Specification Parser", which is used to turn a single OpenGL extension specification text file or URL into a set of compact C source files that can be easily included into existing projects to initialize the desired extension.
