Introduction
============

This documents lists some general conventions I think of as being sensible and
that I try to follow in this project. If you are going to submit patches to the
project or have been granted access to the source code repository, please make
sure you adhere to these rules. After all, there is no rule without exceptions,
so the most important rule should always be:

    "Use common sense!"

In case of doubt, you may refer to resources on the Internet like the excellent

    C++ FAQ Lite

or contact me.

Conventions
===========

Source Formatting
-----------------

- For all top-level control blocks except namespaces write the opening curly
  brace "{" in the first column of the next line. Otherwise, write it in the
  same line as the statement that opens the block, with exactly one space between
  the statement and the opening curly brace.

- Use blocks enclosed by curly braces with proper indenting even for single line
  statements, e.g. single line "if" statements.

- Put the "else" statement into its own line so its first letter lines up with
  the closing curly brace of the block above.

- Use four spaces for indenting, no tabs. Even when used carefully, tabs cause
  too much formatting errors between editors with different tab settings.

- Use exactly one space between language construct and the opening parenthesis
  (e.g. "if (", "while (") and no white-spaces between function names or macros
  and the opening parenthesis (e.g. "strcat(", "printf("). This helps to
  visually distinguish these.

- The line length should not exceed 80 characters. Lines of code that are harder
  to understand if they are reformatted are an exception, but it is a must for
  comments. As many terminals still wrap longer lines, this is a big help when
  viewing the code.

- Write all comments (even regular / non-Doxygen comments) as if they were
  official documentation. This means to use proper spelling, grammar and
  punctuation. Besides being good style, this helps to write clear comments for
  others to understand.

General Coding
--------------

- Define macros all upper case and in such a way that they can be called without
  a trailing semicolon, i.e. not "c=min(a,b);" but "c=MIN(a,b)". This helps to
  visually identify macros in the code and avoids errors if one forgets to add
  the semicolon.

- When declaring pointers, always write the "*" next to the data type, not next
  to the variable name. Do not declare pointer and non-pointer variables of the
  same data type in a single line of code. That is, instead of

    int *data,counter;

  use

    int* data;
    int counter;

  for clarity. As the "*" does semantically belong to the data type, not the to
  variable, it is just consequent to reflect this in the formatting.

- Write the "const" modifier always to the right of the entity that is constant,
  i.e. use "int const PI=3;". As you have no choice when declaring "const"
  methods, it makes sense to always use that rule for consistency.

- Use indented blocks (enclosed by curly braces) even for single lines of code.
  It is much more error prone to use and harder to debug code like

    if (flag) puts("Yippee!");

  than

    if (flag) {
        puts("Yippee!");
    }

  as one might forget to add curly braces when they are desired and its unclear
  when the statement gets executed.

- Avoid deep nesting of conditions, so instead of

    if (cond1) {
        // ...
        if (cond2) {
            // ...
            if (cond3) {
                // ...
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }

  you should prefer

    if (!cond1) {
        return false;
    }

    // ...

    if (!cond2) {
        return false;
    }

    // ...

    if (!cond3) {
        return false;
    }

    // ...

    return true;

  as it is much easier to read and consumes less horizontal space.
