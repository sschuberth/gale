Introduction
============

This documents lists some general conventions I think of as being senseful and
that I try to follow in this project. If you are going to submit patches to the
project or have been granted access to the source code repository, please make
sure you adhere to these rules. After all, there is no rule without exceptions,
so the most important rule should always be:

    "Use common sense!"

In case of doubt, you may refer to resources on the Internet like the excellent

    C++ FAQ Lite

or contact me.

Coding
======

Formatting
----------

- Use four spaces for indenting, no tabs.

- The line length should not exceed 80 characters. Lines of code that are harder
  to understand if reformatted are and exception, but it is a must for comments.

Data Types
----------

- Do not introduce type definitions for primitive data types, the given types
  are well-defined on both Windows and Linux, for 32-bit and 64-bit.

- Use the most common and shortest names, be explicit about unsigned data types.
  I.e. instead of "signed long" write "int", instead of "unsigned" write
  "unsigned int".

General Coding
--------------

- When declaring pointers, always write the "*" next to the data type, not next
  to the variable name. Do not declare pointer and non-pointer variables of the
  same data type in a single line of code. That is, instead of

    int *data,counter;

  use

    int* data;
    int counter;

  for clarity.

- Put the "const" modifier always to the right of what is constant. As you have
  no choice when declaring "const" methods, it makes sense to always use that
  rule for consistency, e.g. instead of "char const* input" use "char const*
  input".
