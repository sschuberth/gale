#define GALE_SSE

    If GALE_SSE is defined, GALE uses SSE instructions on x86 machines to speed
    up certain calculations. Currently, only float 4-tuples and derived classes
    benefit from this define.

#define GALE_TINY

    If GALE_TINY is defined, GALE does not use any external libraries (which
    includes the STL an even the C runtime) to reduce the executable size. As a
    result, several convenience or debugging methods will not be available.
