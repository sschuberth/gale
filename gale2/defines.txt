#define GALE_INIT

    If defined, tuples and related classes are initialized to 0 instead of
    leaving them uninitialized for performance reasons.


#define GALE_SSE
#define GALE_SSE2
#define GALE_SSE3

    If defined, GALE uses SSE / SSE2 / SSE3 instructions on x86 machines to
    speed up certain calculations.


#define GALE_TINY

    If defined, GALE does not use any external libraries (which includes the STL
    an even the C runtime) to reduce the executable size. As a result, several
    convenience or debugging methods will not be available.
