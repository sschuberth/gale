#define GALE_INIT_DATA

    If defined, various class member variables are initialized to 0 on
    instantiation instead of leaving them uninitialized for performance reasons.


#define GALE_TINY_CODE

    If defined, GALE does not use any external libraries (which includes the STL
    an even the C runtime) to reduce the executable size. As a result, several
    convenience or debugging methods will not be available.


#define GALE_USE_VBO

    If defined, explicitly uses Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) for rendering. In
    recent OpenGL drivers, there does not seem to be much performance gain by
    using VBOs, however. Probably the driver internally performs optimizations
    to use VBOs or display lists automatically.


#define GALE_USE_SSE
#define GALE_USE_SSE2
#define GALE_USE_SSE3

    If defined, GALE uses SSE / SSE2 / SSE3 instructions on x86 machines to
    speed up certain calculations.
